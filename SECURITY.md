## Security Best Practices for Users

### Running Locally

When running Celstomp locally:

- Only run the development server on trusted networks

## Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Only

Celstomp is a client-side only application. All data processing happens in the browser:

- No server-side processing of user data
- No user accounts or authentication
- No data collection or tracking
- All projects are stored locally in your browser

### File Imports

When importing files (palettes, projects):

- Only import files from trusted sources
- JSON files are parsed but not executed
- Always verify the content of imported files

### Browser Storage

The application uses browser localStorage for:
- Autosave functionality

Clear your browser data to remove all stored information.
