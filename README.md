# Celstomp_v1
a site where you could animate on (vibecoded help)

I'd like to preface by saying that this site was vibecoded.

I'm by no means in any way a traditional programmer, but i had just wanted to make animation more accessible and intuitive.
Therefore i'm including all the messy comments the AI had wrote, as i understand that it may be helpful for some trying to navigate around the horrendous code. (I apologize for this)

I come from an art background, but interested in learning code.
I'm a bit ashamed of using vibecoding to create this, so any feedback about this will be greatly appreciated as im trying to learn along the way. Thank you!

    When you draw a specific color on a selected layer, it a color swatch should appear on the right of the layer. 
    You can right click a specific layer to adjust its opacity, or clip to the layer below.
    The layering of the swatches works so that the one on the right is the most on top.
    You can drag the swatches to reorder them all over the layer system.
    You can right click the swatches to change the color of all the cels in the timeline.
